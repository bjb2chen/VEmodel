# vmodels

### Repository for vibronic models construction. Developed in collaboration between Nooijen/Zeng group.

### Protocol procedure. Instructions on how to run the code:
#### - You first need to ensure you have GAMESS with Toby's diabatization (gmcpt.src) module installed.
#### - Configure rungms, runG_diab, and subgam.diab scripts to the appropriate $USER.
#### - Create GAMESS scratch directories if necessary (.gamess_ascii_files and gamess_scr)
